# Firm

*This app was made in C in my first year of uni in Code::Blocks as part of a project for one of the courses.*

### Requirements for the project:
1. Program type menu containing statistic information about different firms.
2. The statistic info should be stored in a binary file and containing the following data - bulstat, firm's name, profit from the last 5 years, registration date.
3. The data for each firm should be stored in a separate txt file and named with the bulstat of the firm.
4. There should be a dialog window with the options for adding a new firm, updating the info of the current firm, checkup for all the firms with average profit compliant to an interval, by bulstat to display the firm's info.
5. The data should be maintained in a dynamic structure.
